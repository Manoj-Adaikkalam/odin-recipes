    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The authentic tandoori chicken that's marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked on the grill instead of a clay oven so you can make it at home. Serve with long-grain basmati rice, grilled veggies, roasted corn on the cob, and a cucumber salad</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Yoghurt</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring</li>
        <li>Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better)</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining marinade</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges</li>
    </ol>
